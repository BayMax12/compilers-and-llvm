##Economy of programming languages.##

**Q. Why are there so many programming lanuages?**

Applications domains have distinctive/conflicting needs.

* Scientific Computing: `good FP, good Arrays, Parallelism.` -> FORTRAN is a good example.
* Bussiness Applications: `persistence, report generation, data anlysis` -> SQL
* Systems Programming: `low level control of resources, real time contraints` -> C/C++

**Q. Why are there new programming languages?**

Claim: Programmer training is the dominant cost for a programming language. [Time]

Predictions:

1. Widely used languages will be slow to change. [Need to educate everyone.]
2. Easy to start a new language. [Start with 0 users.]
    1. Productivity > training cost. => Switch.
3. Languages adopted to fill a void. [Mobile computing]

**Q. What is a good programming languages?**

There is **no** *universally accepted* metric for language design.

* A good language is one people use?
  * Measures the popularity of language.
  * Conclusion: Visual Basic is the best language! But not quite true.

####Conclusion####

* Application domains have conflicting needs. Difficult to design one system to get all features.
* Programmer training is the dominant cost for a programming language.
